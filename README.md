# Explaining black box models through games
### -- first experiments using Shapley approach

The goal of this study project was to build and train a model that classifies flooded areas in remote sensing images.
and to estimate the contribution of each input feature (individual bands of the remote sensing images) to the classification result
through calculating the Shapley Value for each input feature.
